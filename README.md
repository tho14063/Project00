Project 00

I am having trouble with elisp, so most of my time was spent on trying to figure it out. I've 
finished most of the exercises and the key terms. I tried the elisp functions somewhat
unsuccessfully, but got the mapcar function working. I think that the logic for the factorial
function is correct, but haven't gotten the code to work quite yet. It is giving me an error
saying something about a lambda function. I never got to the special project.

I worked all alone on this project (except for a bit of time in Brother Benning's office).
